##Hello Octocat
I love Octocat. She's the coolest cat in town.

# statistical test
Z <- chisq.test(y, correct = TRUE)

##Underlying assumptions
#two categorical variables from a single population
#used to determine whether there is an association between 2 variable names 
## interpretation of outcomes
#p< 0.05, therefor reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternative hypothesis

```
```{r Nausea, echo=TRUE}
###chunk 3
##Null hypothesis
#Recieving chemotherapy does not cause nausea
##Alternative hypothesis
#Recieving chemotherapy does cause nausea
# read the intensity of nausea
A <- read.csv("nausea (1).csv")

#tidy data
# rating scale is anchored at 0(no nausea) to 6(severe nausea and vomiting) therefore change row 8 coloumn 3.

legend ("top", c("Nausea_before", "Nausea_after"),fill = c("black", "green"))

# statistical test
wilcox.test(A$Nausea_before, A$Nausea_after, paired = TRUE)
## Test assumption
#The data is paired and non-parametric
#two measurements were taken from the same sample group. 
#P< 0.05 Therefore reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternative hypothesis

```
```{r echo= TRUE}
##Null hypothesis
#The housing price is not dependent on the interest rate
##Alternative hypothesis
#The housing price is dependent on the interest rate
# import data

G <- read.csv("housing-prices (1).csv")
G
# Tidy data
interest= G$interest_rate
house_price = G$median_house_price_USD
head(cbind(interest, house_price))

# scatter plot
plot( interest, house_price, xlab= "interest", ylab = "house_price")
abline(lm(G$median_house_price_USD ~ G$interest_rate, data = G), col= "blue", lwd= 2)
# linear regression

abline(h=0, col= "green", lwd= 2)

#diagnostic plot 2 : Gaussian residual distribution
qqnorm(G1$residuals)
qqline(G1$residuals)

# Binary outcome variable: the variables have non-Gaussian error distribution
glm (G$median_house_price_USD ~ G$interest_rate, data = G)

## test assumptions
  #I did the scatter plot to determine the trend or the relationship
  # disgnostics for linear regression
  # I did qq plot to determine if the residuals are normally distributed 
  # I did the Gaussian residual distribution to determine the variance of the fitted values
  # I did the generalized linear model because the diagnostics I ran were not normally distributed.
  ## test interpretation
  # p-value = 0.01937 therefore reject the null hypotehsis and accept the  alternative hypothesis.
  # degrees of freedom : 15 Total (i.e. Null);  14 Residual
  # test statistics
  # F-statistic: 6.974 on 1
